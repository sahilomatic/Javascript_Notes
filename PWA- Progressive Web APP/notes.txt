1) Service worker is a js file, which keeps running independent from main react application, it is ued to handle how app works in offline mode, push notifications, cache pages and data.
2) PWA should only run https protocol as service worker are always running, thus it can cause security concern
3) Manifest.json contains an array of logo images and help us to make application installable
4) PWA can be stored in PWA stores.

Service Worker:
ServiceWorker,js file should be created in root folder to control all the files in that folder, if e create it in some other folder suppose 
/img then lifecycle of that service worker would be only in that folder
it usually has 3 parts ,using enevent listener

SeviceWorker can only work when protocol is https , localhost is exception to develop app. https is required because service worker is very powerful and might create security issues.

1) addEventlistener( 'Install') : this is used to install statich cache using addAll, we can store array of data in cache

2) addEventlistener( 'Activate'): this part is used to update cache from old version

3) addEventlistener( 'fetch') : 
a)this part serves as an intermediate between browser and request, if request is in cache it return cache data respondWith event.request
b) we can also update cahce dynamically here based on last page visited by the user
c) we can also send offline fallback back here if user is offline.


Manifest.json is required which contains meta details of application like icons for different viewport, app name, short name, source location, 
This is required to make app installable.
